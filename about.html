## About
I am part of the Data Science and Software Development team at <a href="https://www.projectarkera.com/" target="_blank">Arkera</a> and was their first Data hire. We predominantly use <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a> and <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/" target="_blank">Postgresql</a> in <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank">Docker</a> on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">AWS</a> to serve an <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/" target="_blank">iOS app</a>.
I was previously the first Data hire at <a href="https://www.stylect.com/gb/" target="_blank">Stylect</a> where I built their first recommender system for their app and website, utilising my expertise in <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/basic/tutorial.html" target="_blank">Machine Learning</a>.
In December 2015 I <a href="http://london.bigdataweek.com/speaker/greg-lever/" target="_blank"> spoke at Big Data Week 2015</a>, co-hosting the workshop: <a href="http://blog.bigdataweek.com/2015/11/04/become-effective-data-scientist-answers-bests/" target="_blank">"How to Become an Effective Data Scientist"</a>.
I transitioned into industry through a Postodoctoral Fellow on the Data Science & Business Analytics Fellowship offered by The ASI. I was previously a <a href="https://engineeringphds.mit.edu/profile/greg-lever" target="_blank">Postdoctoral Research Associate at MIT</a>. I <a href="http://www.tcm.phy.cam.ac.uk/~gl319/" target="_blank">completed my Ph.D.</a> at the <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University of Cambridge</a> where <a href="http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/246261" target="_blank">my thesis</a> won the Springer Thesis Prize: "Recognising Outstanding Ph.D. Research" and is published in the <a href="http://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319193502" target="_blank">Springer Thesis Program</a>.
