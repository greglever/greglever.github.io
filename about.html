## About
I am part of the Bioinformatics team at <a href="https://www.genomicsengland.co.uk/" target="_blank">Genomics England</a>
Previously I was the first Data hire at <a href="https://www.projectarkera.com/" target="_blank">Arkera</a> and built the foundation of their Data platform.
Before that I was the first Data hire at <a href="https://www.stylect.com/gb/" target="_blank">Stylect</a> where I built their first recommender system for their app and website, utilising my expertise in <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/basic/tutorial.html" target="_blank">Machine Learning</a>.
In December 2015 I <a href="http://london.bigdataweek.com/speaker/greg-lever/" target="_blank"> spoke at Big Data Week 2015</a>, co-hosting the workshop: <a href="http://blog.bigdataweek.com/2015/11/04/become-effective-data-scientist-answers-bests/" target="_blank">"How to Become an Effective Data Scientist"</a>.
I transitioned into industry through a Postdoctoral Fellow on the Data Science & Business Analytics Fellowship offered by The ASI. I was previously a <a href="http://hjkgrp.mit.edu/content/greg-lever" target="_blank">Postdoctoral Research Associate at MIT</a>. I <a href="http://www.tcm.phy.cam.ac.uk/~gl319/" target="_blank">completed my Ph.D.</a> at the <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University of Cambridge</a> (you can spot me <a href="http://www.tcm.phy.cam.ac.uk/news/tcm60.jpg" target="_blank">in the bottom left corner here</a> in the 60th Anniversary photo of my former research group) where <a href="http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/246261" target="_blank">my thesis</a> won the Springer Thesis Prize: "Recognising Outstanding Ph.D. Research" and is published in the <a href="http://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319193502" target="_blank">Springer Thesis Program</a>.
