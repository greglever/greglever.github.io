## About
In December 2015 I <a href="http://london.bigdataweek.com/speaker/greg-lever/" target="_blank"> spoke at Big Data Week 2015</a>, co-hosting the workshop: <a href="http://blog.bigdataweek.com/2015/11/04/become-effective-data-scientist-answers-bests/" target="_blank">"How to Become an Effective Data Scientist"</a>.
I transitioned into industry through a Postodoctoral Fellow on the Data Science & Business Analytics Fellowship offered by The ASI. I was previously a <a href="https://engineeringphds.mit.edu/profile/greg-lever" target="_blank">Postdoctoral Research Associate at MIT</a>. I <a href="http://www.tcm.phy.cam.ac.uk/~gl319/" target="_blank">completed my Ph.D.</a> at the <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University of Cambridge</a> where my thesis won the Springer Thesis Prize: "Recognising Outstanding Ph.D. Research" and is published in the <a href="http://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319193502" target="_blank">Springer Thesis Program</a>.
